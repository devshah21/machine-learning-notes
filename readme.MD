# Deep Learning Notes (by Dev Shah)

Welcome to my repository where I've been learning about deep learning / machine learning. Each directory is either a textbook or lecture series which I have watched or read. Within each one, you'll find a readme or python files with implementations of some important ML algorithms. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions! Happy learning :)
